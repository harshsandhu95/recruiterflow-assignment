## Recruiterflow Assignment

### Tasks:

- Create a list of items and display them to look like cards.
- Use mock APIs to get the data.
- Keep a delete icon or a button inside each card.
- When the delete button is pressed, the corresponding card has to be removed from the UI (it's a plus if you use an API).The UI has to be re-arranged on each delete (kudos for using transition/animation)
- Place new cards in the UI on click of an add icon or button.
